## Project description

Classic Hangman game that I recreated. The code works very well with multiple difficulties and phrases.

## How to compile and run the program

```bash
cd ./project
g++ Hangman.cpp
Hangman.exe
```

## UI Design

Upon loading into the program you are asked to select a difficulty (see Fig 1). Once you select a difficulty you are brought to a blank hangman game and it asks for a letter (see Fig 2). If you input a correct letter it fills out the spots where that letter goes in the phrase (see Fig 3). If you input a wrong letter the man starts to form on the gallows and it lists the letter you got wrong (see Fig 4). If you input something other than a letter you get a message telling you it is invalid (see Fig 5).
